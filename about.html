                        industry, along with Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook.[8][9][10][11] The company has been
                        referred to as "one
                        of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world", as well as the world's most

                        Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. The company started
                        as an online marketplace for books but expanded to sell electronics, software, video games,
                        apparel, furniture, food,
                        toys, and jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United
                        States by market capitalization.[14] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for US$13.4
                        billion, which
                        substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[15] In 2018, Bezos announced that
                        its two-day delivery service, Amazon Prime, had surpassed 100 million subscribers
                        worldwide.[16][17]

                        Amazon is known for its disruption of well-established industries through technological
                        innovation and mass scale.[18][19][20] It is the world's largest online marketplace, AI
                        assistant provider, live-streaming
                        platform and cloud computing platform[21] as measured by revenue and market capitalization.[22]
                        Amazon is the largest Internet company by revenue in the world.[23] It is the second largest
                        private employer in the
                        United States[24] and one of the world's most valuable companies.

                        criticized for various practices including technological surveillance overreach,[25] a
                        hyper-competitive and demanding work
                        culture,[26] tax avoidance,[27] and for being anti-competitive.[28][29]

                    <p>
                        Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in July 1994. He chose Seattle because of technical talent as
                        Microsoft is located there.[30] In May 1997, the organization went public. The company began
                        selling music and videos in
                        1998, at which time it began operations internationally by acquiring online sellers of books in
                        United Kingdom and Germany. The following year, the organization also sold video games, consumer
                        electronics,
                        home-improvement items, software, games, and toys in addition to other items.

                        In 2002, the corporation started Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provided data on Web site
                        popularity, Internet traffic patterns and other statistics for marketers and developers. In
                        2006, the organization grew
                        its AWS portfolio when Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which rents computer processing power as
                        well as Simple Storage Service (S3), that rents data storage via the Internet, were made
                        available. That same year, the
                        company started Fulfillment by Amazon which managed the inventory of individuals and small
                        companies selling their belongings through the company internet site. In 2012, Amazon bought
                        Kiva Systems to automate its
                        inventory-management business, purchasing Whole Foods Market supermarket chain five years later
                        in 2017.[31]

                    <p>In December 2020, Amazon said it would acquire podcast startup Wondery, aiming to beef up
                        non-musical content on its Amazon Music app.[3</p>
